# Art Trivia!

##Details on the assignment
This is the creation of a trivia Game. This app is useful because it shows how jQuery code can be used alongside Javascript to dynamically update HTML and CSS. The main focus is on using jQuery code, especially for the timer shown on the page.

##Details on the game
This is a trivia form with multiple choice questions. The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. You cannot pick more than one answer per question. Don't forget you will be timed!

##Why make this game?
This project is useful because it shows how a simple HTML can be changed by jQuery & Javascript to make a dynamic game. It also shows the efficiency of using jQuery vs. all Javascript. 

##How you create the game
The creation of this game starts out with pseudo-coding all of the steps in detail. Then comes the assigning of variables, creating functions, if/else statements, and the jQuery syntax. After you've checked that the game is working through console.log you can go in and edit the HTML elements with jQuery to make the webpage become a functioning dynamic game.

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, and W3 Schools which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (Google Fu!) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself!

Put your knowledge to the test! Good luck!
